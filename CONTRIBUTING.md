Thank you for your interest in contributing to _Den Frie Prøvebank_! 

This document is focused on helping you report errors or issues with our exam papers, so that we can crowdsource corrections and improvements.

## Creating a GitHub Account

Github is where coders come to share and collaborate on code. It's also the best, easiest way to crowdsource corrections to our exam papers.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need one to report issues. Here's how to create one:

1. **Create a free Github account** - Click the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the page. Enter the usual details - email, username, etc.

3. **Verify your account** - GitHub will send you an email to verify your account. Check your email and click the verification link.

That's it! You now have a GitHub account and can report issues with our exam papers.

## How to File an Issue

Once you have a GitHub account, reporting an issue is straightforward:

1. **Navigate to our repository** - Go to the _Den Frie Prøvebank_ repository at <a href="https://github.com/sorenfrederiksen/den-frie-proevebank-exams">github.com/sorenfrederiksen/den-frie-proevebank-exams</a>.

2. **Click "Issues"** - Look for the "Issues" tab near the top of the page, between "Code" and "Pull requests".

3. **Create a new issue** - Click the green "New issue" button.

4. **Choose an issue type** - If prompted, select the type of issue you're reporting (you may see options like "Bug report" or "Feature request").

5. **Fill in the details** - Give your issue a clear title and describe the problem in the text box. Be sure to include:
   - Which exam or test paper you were looking at
   - What the problem is (incorrect answer, typo, unclear question, etc.)
   - Where exactly in the document you found the issue

6. **Submit the issue** - Click the green "Submit new issue" button.

We'll get a notification about your issue and can start working on fixing it!

## Tips for Writing a Good Issue

Here are a few tips to help us understand and fix your issue quickly:

1. **Be specific** - Instead of "Test 5 has problems," try "Test 5, Question 12 has an incorrect answer key - the correct answer should be B, not C." The more specific you are, the faster we can locate and fix the problem.

2. **Include context** - Let us know which exam type (Studieprøven, PD2, PD3) and which specific test you're referring to. If possible, mention the page number or section where you found the issue.

## Code of Conduct

All contributions are appreciated, but those that adhere to this code of conduct especially so:

1. Be decent. (It's just a bunch of AI-generated test papers. Nothing to get worked up about.)
2. Understand this is a hobby project. (I'll try to get to it as fast as I can, but I also have a kolonihave.)
